# A10: Presentation
 
## 1. Product presentation
  
Within the scope of the LBAW course, we were proposed to develop a web application for collaborative Questions and Answers, thus _Answerly_ was born. This artifact aims to support a presentation of the final product.

With our product, a user can ask questions, elaborate answers and comment. A user may also create an account and check its profile, or see other users public profile information. Moderators and Administrators have access to a moderation area, where they can manage system's content. Moderators can edit other users' questions, answers and comments. Administrators can edit and delete other users' content. They are also abled to ban, demote and promote users.
