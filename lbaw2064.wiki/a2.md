# A2: Actors and User stories 

Within the scope of the LBAW course, we were proposed to develop a web application for collaborative Questions and Answers, thus _Answerly_ was born.

This artifact specifies the actors, their descriptions and user stories. It also shows the project supplementary requirements.

## 1. Actors

For the **Answerly** system, the actors are represented in Figure 1 and their descriptions in Table 1.

## A1. Annex: Supplementary requirements

This annex contains all types of supplementary requirements for the project, such as business rules, technical requirements and other non-functional requirements.

### A1.1 Business rules

| Identifier | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BR01 | Voting | Users cannot vote on their own questions or answers |
| BR02 | Delete content | Only Administrators can remove content such as questions, replies or comments from the website |
| BR3 | Authenticated user banishment | When a user is banished his content remains on the system, but he is now unable to log in and his questions, answers and comments show the information that the user was banished |
| BR04 | Administrator and Moderator banishment | Administrators and Moderators cannot be banished |
| BR05 | Answers date | The date of an answer must be greater than or equal to the date of the respective question |
| BR06 | Comments date | The date of a comment must be greater than or equal to the date of the respective answer |
| BR07 | Content removal and score | The deletion of previously voted questions and answers doesn't change the owner's score |

### A1.2 Technical requirements

| Identifier | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TR01 | Availability | The system must be available 100 percent of the time |
| TR02 | Accessibility | The system must be accessible regardless the Web browser used |
| TR03 | Usability | The system should be intuitive, visually appealing and simple to use |
| TR04 | Performance | The system should send responses in times shorter than 2s to keep users interested |
| TR05 | Web application | The system should be implemented as a Web application with dynamic pages, using the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JavaScript |
| TR06 | Portability | The server-side system should be compatible for various platforms, such as Linux, Windows and Mac OS |
| TR07 | Database | It should be used the PostgreSQL 9.4 database management system to store data |
| TR08 | Security | The system shall protect users profile information and stored passwords from unauthorized accesses by providing authentication and verification systems |
| TR09 | Robustness | The system should be prepared to handle runtime errors and exceptions privileging the continuation of the system’s execution |
| TR010 | Scalability | The system must be prepared to deal with a large number of users and their actions without overloading the server |
| TR11 | Ethics | The system must respect the ethical principles in software development (for examlpe, user’s profile private data should not be shared with other users or with the public in general) |

The most crucial technical requirements, thus the ones which must be accomplished at all costs, are TR05, TR08 and TR10. A Web application is a simple, easy and quick access system with wide reach, so it seems appropriate to develop one on the circumstances of this project. Nowadays, web security and privacy politics are two topics largely discussed and with an increasing importance. Users must feel safe when using our system, knowing that it follows the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR – May 2018). As the focus of the website is to promote user interaction it is expected that the system can support a big amount of activity while not delaying user experience.

### A1.3 Restrictions

| Identifier | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Deadline | The system should be finished and ready to be used before the end of the second semester, since it is a college project |

## Revision history
1. First submission (24/02/2020).
2. Minor changes in User Stories; added User Story to promote Admins; changed priorities in Moderator and Admin's User Stories; switched Ethics to Scalability as a crucial technical requirement (03/03/2020).
3. Specified the API as Google Sign In API in the actors' diagram and added user stories regarding search and select best answer features (10/03/2020).
