## 3. Application Help

In order to improve the user experience, we added some help buttons to better inform the user the information thats is being presented to them in that page:

**Question:** Here it is explained to the user in what this page consists, what reports are and what the marked answers mean

![Question Help](./screenshots/help-question.png)

**Profile:** In the profile we explain what information is presented, what you can edit and what a user's score means

## 4. Input Validation

For input validation on the client side, we used Javascript to validate the creation of a new question.

```Javascript
function sendCreateQuestionRequest(event) {

    let title = document.getElementById("formControlTextareaQuestion").value;
    let description = document.getElementById("formControlTextareaDescription").value;

    if (title != '' && description != '')
        sendAjaxRequest('put', '/api/question', { title: title, description: description }, questionAddedHandler);
    else {

        let older_alert = document.getElementById('alert_question');
        if (older_alert != null)
            return;

        let new_alert = createAlertQuestion();

        let section = document.getElementById("add_question_form");
        let list = document.getElementById("add_question_form");

        section.insertBefore(new_alert, list.childNodes[0]);

        return;

    }

    event.preventDefault();

}
function createAlertQuestion() {
    let new_alert = document.createElement('alert');
    new_alert.classList.add('alert');
    new_alert.innerHTML = ` <div id="alert_question" class="card text-white bg-danger">
                                <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">You must fill both title and description</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>`
    return new_alert;
}
```

We used server-side validators on the registration of the users.

```php 

protected function validator(array $data)
    {
        return Validator::make($data, [
            'first_name' => 'required|string|max:100',
            'last_name' => 'required|string|max:100',
            'email' => 'required|string|email|max:200|unique:user',
            'bio' => 'required|string|max:500',
            'username' => 'required|string|max:100|unique:user',
            'password' => 'required|string|min:6|confirmed',
        ]);
    }

    protected function create(array $data)
    {
        return User::create([
            'first_name' => $data['first_name'],
            'last_name' => $data['last_name'],
            'email' => $data['email'],
            'bio' => $data['bio'],
            'username' => $data['username'],
            'password' => bcrypt($data['password']),
        ]);
    }

```
## 5. Check Accessibility and Usability

Accessibility results: 14/18

Usability results: 24/28

## 6. HTML & CSS Validation

We had some errors on the pagination and we did not changed much regarding that since it was intrinsic to Laravel. Besides that we had no more errors.
We also had a few warnings that we did not find relevant.
